# UMAP
Experiments with UMAP : finding patterns in data sets, without knowing anything.

UMAP is described in https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters.html

A sample data set describes the velocity and size of traffic passing by on the road.
UMAP finds clusters in this data, without any training. Upon inspection, these clusters turn out to correspond to specific kinds of traffic.
